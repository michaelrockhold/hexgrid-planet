# HexGridPlanet

This project is a Swift library implementing features very similar to part of the old earthgen C++ program. Please see https://github.com/vraid/earthgen-old for more information about that project. My goals are a little different to the author of that library; in particular, I wanted a good real-world exercise in Swift coding. But I also have some plans for this library if it works out OK:

 - "sperical" versions of several games more typically played on a 2-D board, like the Game of Life, or chess
 - a weird idea I have for a geographic coordinate system similar to (but cooler than) Google's Plus Codes
 - simple and cheap GIS-related data visualization, for instance a kind of population-based cartogram that should help make it easy to see relationships between countries and regions, having removed the distortions of projection. More details on this later.
